## App Descirption:
I created a straightforward snack decision-making app for my father and other non-native English speaking diabetics facing dietary challenges. Users enter a snack, fruit, or other food item, and the app, leveraging the Edman Food Nutrition Database, computes glucose levels and estimates the glycemic index. Based on these calculations, it provides a clear 'yes' or 'no', assisting in making educated dietary decisions. Initially constructed with Python and Flask, this app was later redeveloped using the MERN stack.

## TO DO:
- Improve Glycemic Index Calculations
- Media
