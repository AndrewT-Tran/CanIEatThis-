# CanIEatThis? - Simplifying Dietary Choices for Diabetics

## App Descirption:
I created a straightforward snack decision-making app for my father and other non-native English speaking diabetics facing dietary challenges. Users enter a snack, fruit, or other food item, and the app, leveraging the Edman Food Nutrition Database, computes glucose levels and estimates the glycemic index. Based on these calculations, it provides a clear 'yes' or 'no', assisting in making educated dietary decisions. Initially constructed with Python and Flask, this app was later redeveloped using the MERN stack.

##  Technical Execution:

- API Integration: Utilized AXIOS for seamless interaction with the Edman Nutritional Databases. This integration is key in sourcing reliable data about various food items.
- Data Manipulation: Expertly handled data fetched from the API, focusing on the presentation of nutritional information in a user-friendly manner.
Glycemic Index Computation: Implemented a feature to calculate the Glycemic Index of foods. This function plays a crucial role in guiding users about food choices that are advisable or inadvisable for diabetic diets.
- User Interface: Leveraged React to develop a responsive and intuitive interface. This aspect of the application ensures ease of use for the target demographic, aligning with the app's goal of accessibility and simplicity.

- Impact: By identifying and addressing a niche need, CanIEatThis? stands out as an innovative solution that combines technical proficiency with a deep understanding of user requirements. It exemplifies a thoughtful application of technology in healthcare, particularly in supporting the elderly and those with specific language needs.
